# Level 2 Final Exercise - R Bootcamp
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Part 0: Setup

# 0.1: Load the tidyverse package


# 0.2: Import titanic dataset with the given url
titanic_url <- 'https://www.dropbox.com/s/whhrdrk9t9he8o3/titanic_train.csv?dl=1'
titanic <- 

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Part 1: Indexing
# 1.1: What value is stored at row 12, column 4 of the titanic dataset



# 1.2: What is the average Age between rows 7 to 17



# 1.3 What is the maximum fair that someone has paid? (max in Fair column)



# 1.4 What is the minimum fair that someone has paid? (min in Fair column)




#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Part 2: Basic dataframe handling

# 2.1.a: Filter the titanic dataset and get the individuals older than 60
# HINT: older than 65 means that their Age is higher than 60



# 2.1.b: 2.1.a + older than 60 and Survived
# HINT: Surviving means that the Survived entry is equal to 1



# 2.1.c: older than 60 and Survived and male



# 2.2: Use pipes for this questions
# 1. Sort the titanic dataset using arrange and based on Age column
# 2. Filter the data for anyone who paid more than 100 for fare and is male
# 3. Assing this value to a variable named q22



# 2.3: What is the name of the 10th person in the q22? (HINT: Use indexing)
